// This file is often used with the Vercel AI SDK (ai package)
// for creating utility functions around streaming, but for a basic
// OpenAI API call with streaming, much of the logic can live directly
// in the API route handler or a server action using the `ai` package's helpers.

// For example, if you were to use OpenAI Functions with streaming,
// you might have more complex stream parsing logic here.

// For now, we'll keep this minimal, as the primary streaming logic
// will be in `app/api/chat-completion/route.ts` using `OpenAIStream` and `StreamingTextResponse`
// from the `ai` package.

/**
 * Example: A utility to parse streamed data if it were more complex.
 * The `ai` package handles most of this for simple text streaming.
